# Profit-Maximization-Taxi
We try to maximise the profit of a taxi driver. We try to understand which factors explain this profit level. We define two situations:
- when the taxi has informations before the ride
- when the taxi has no informations.
We use a regression to explain the profit. The data is composed by 170 millions of rides for the year 2013 in New York City. It is extracted from the website: http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/
